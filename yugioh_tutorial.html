      <h2>Ruleset</h2>
      <p>The Yugioh Ruleset consists of these basic principles</p>
      <ul>
          <li>There are two players, each with 8000 life points (LP for short). This is their Health bar. When it reaches zero, that player will lose.</li>
          <li>Each player starts with 5 cards.</li>
          <li>There are 2 decks for each player: the main deck, which consists of normal, effect, spell, and trap cards (minimum of 40, maximum of 60), and the extra deck, which contains Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monsters (0-15 cards).</li>
          <li>If a player runs out of cards to draw, they lose the duel.</li>
          <li>The game consists of 6 phases: draw, standby, main, battle, main 2, and end.</li>
          <li>The phases are:
              <ul>
                  <li>Draw Phase: The player draws one card from their main deck. The player who plays the first turn of the game does not draw in their draw phase.</li>
                  <li>Standby Phase: Nothing happens unless a card's effect activates during this phase.</li>
                  <li>Main Phase: The player summons monsters and activates spells and traps to employ their strategy.</li>
                  <li>Battle Phase: The player commands their monsters to attack the other player. The first turn of the game does not have a battle phase.
                      <ul>
                          <li>When battling, the monster with the higher attack wins. The player only takes damage when their monster is attacked in attack mode.</li>
                          <li>When attacking a monster with higher defense, the attacker takes damage, but neither card is destroyed.</li>
                          <li>When monsters with equal attack points battle, both are destroyed.</li>
                          <li>When there are no monsters to attack, the player can attack their opponent directly, reducing their LP.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              <li>Main Phase 2: Similar to Main Phase 1.</li>
              <li>End Phase: The player ends their turn. Effects that activate during the end phase trigger here.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There are two main ways to summon monsters: Normal Summons and Special Summons.
              <ul>
                  <li>Normal Summon: The player places a monster card from their hand onto the field. This can only be done once per turn.</li>
                  <li>Special Summon: The player places a monster from their hand or deck based on a card's effect. This can be done multiple times per turn.</li>
                  <li>Flip Summon: When a face-down monster is flipped face up, often to activate its effect.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When cards are removed from play, they go to either the Graveyard or the Banishment Zone.
              <ul>
                  <li>The Graveyard: Cards destroyed or used go here. Effects that have Graveyard requirements activate here.</li>
                  <li>Banishment Zone: Cards that are banished are sent here. Some effects can interact with banished cards, but face-down banished cards are unplayable.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The field has zones for monsters, spells, traps, field spells, and extra deck monsters.</li>
      </ul>
